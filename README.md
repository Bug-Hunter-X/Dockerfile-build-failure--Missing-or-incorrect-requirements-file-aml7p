This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images: issues with the requirements file specified in the Dockerfile.  The original `Dockerfile` contains an error resulting in a build failure. The `Dockerfile_solution` provides the corrected version.  This example uses a simple Python application, but the principle applies to any language and dependency management system.
